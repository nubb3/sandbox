# sandbox
various sands for different things, mostly for wiz tho.

# usage
first, you will need to get an updated list of sands. to do that, please run
``sandbox --sand -update (optional) -ver {version}`` though likely you just want the latest sands

then, once you have the latest sands, you can list them.
``sandbox --sand -list`` you can now choose a sand with the following:
``sandbox --sand {sandname}`` 
the sand will either install itself or provide you instructions.

if you need help: ``sandbox -help``

coming 2030
